/// # Safety
///
/// You may only implement this trait for a type if it meets all of the following conditions:
/// 1. This type must not be a union, pointer, or reference.
/// 2. Condition #1 must hold recursively for this types fields, variants, or elements (if it has any).
/// 3. This types [`PartialEq`] impl must be equivalent to bytewise comparing all non-padding bytes of the data.
///
/// If the type fails to meet any one of these, implementing this trait is considered to be UB.
///
/// # How to implement this trait
///
/// The easiest and recommended way to argue that the implementation of this trait is safe is to ensure:
///
/// 1. All of the types fields or variants (if it has any) implement [`SureEq`].
/// 2. Use the `std` derive macros, namely `#[derive(PartialEq, Eq)]` to derive [`PartialEq`] and [`Eq`]
///
/// (FIXME: the above doesn't account for the fact that this wouldn't make the `Eq` impl `const`).
///
/// If these conditions are fulfilled, this is sufficient to argue that the 3 required preconditions are followed.
